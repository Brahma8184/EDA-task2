Netflix data analysis:

Netflix Dataset – Simple Summary

1. Basic Info:
   - We looked at the data and saw that it includes movies and TV shows on Netflix.
   - Each row is one title (like a movie or a series).

2. Statistics:
   - We checked how many movies and shows there are.
   - Most of the content is Movies.
   - Every title name is different (unique).

3. Charts:
   - Histograms showed how values are spread (like years).
   - Boxplots helped us find unusual values (outliers).

4. Relationships:
   - We checked if the numbers are related (like one going up with another).
   - No strong connection found — most of the data is text, not numbers.

5. Trends We Found:
   - Most titles were released in the last few years (2018–2020).
   - The USA, India, and the UK make the most content.
   - TV Shows are fewer than Movies.

6. Missing Info:
   - Some data is missing (like country or cast).
   - A few descriptions are repeated.
